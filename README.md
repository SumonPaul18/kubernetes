## Introduction
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Definitions
- **Pod**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster.
- **Node**: A worker machine in Kubernetes, which can be a VM or a physical machine.
- **Cluster**: A set of nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
- **Service**: An abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
